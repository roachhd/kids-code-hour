# How to teach one Hour of Code

## 1) Watch this how-to video

## 2) Try the tutorials:

We'll host a variety of fun, hour-long tutorials for students of all ages, created by a variety of partners. New tutorials are coming to kick off the Hour of Code before December 8-14.

**All Hour of Code tutorials:**

* Require minimal [prep-time for teachers](/tutorials/teachers-notes/)
* Are self-guided - allowing students to work at their own pace and skill-level

## 3) Check out events on the map.

[Make sure to sign up][2]. We'll send you helpful info as the Hour of Code nears, and you'll see your Hour of Code on our map of worldwide events.

## 4) Plan your hardware needs - computers are optional

The best Hour of Code experience will be with Internet-connected computers. But you don't need a computer for every child, and can even do the Hour of Code without a computer at all.

* **Test tutorials on student computers or devices.** Make sure they work properly (with sound and video).
* **Preview the congrats page** to see what students will see when they finish.
* **Provide headphones for your class**, or ask students to bring their own, if the tutorial you choose works best with sound.

## 5) Plan ahead based on your technology available

* **Don't have enough devices?** Use [pair programming][3]. When students partner up, they help each other and rely less on the teacher. They'll also see that computer science is social and collaborative.
* **Have low bandwidth?** Plan to show videos at the front of the class, so each student isn't downloading their own videos. Or try the unplugged / offline tutorials.

## 6) Inspire students - show them a video

Show students an inspirational video to kick off the Hour of Code. Examples:

**Get your students excited - give them a short intro**

Most kids don't know what computer science is. Here are some ideas:

* Explain it in a simple way that includes examples of applications that both boys and girls will care about (saving lives, helping people, connecting people, etc.).
* Try: "Think about things in your everyday life that use computer science: a cell phone, a microwave, a computer, a traffic lightâ€¦ all of these things needed a computer scientist to help build them."
* Or: "Computer science is the art of blending human ideas and digital tools to increase our power. Computer scientists work in so many different areas: writing apps for phones, curing diseases, creating animated movies, working on social media, building robots that explore other planets and so much more."
* See tips for getting girls interested in computer science [here][4].

## 7) Start your Hour of Code

**Direct students to the activity**

**When your students come across difficulties**

* Tell students, "Ask 3 then me." Ask 3 classmates, and if they don't have the answer, then ask the teacher.
* Encourage students and offer positive reinforcement: "You're doing great, so keep trying."
* It's okay to respond: "I don't know. Let's figure this out together." If you can't figure out a problem, use it as a good learning lesson for the class: "Technology doesn't always work out the way we want. Together, we're a community of learners." And: "Learning to program is like learning a new language; you won't be fluent right away."

**What to do if a student finishes early?**

* Students can see all tutorials and try another Hour of Code activity at [code.org/learn][5]
* Or, ask students who finish early to help classmates who are having trouble with the activity.

**How do I print certificates for my students?**

Each student gets a chance to get a certificate via email when they finish the [Code.org tutorials][6]. You can click on the certificate to print it. However, if you want to make new certificates for your students, visit our [Certificates][7] page to print as many certificates as you like, in one fell swoop!

**What comes after the Hour of Code?**

The Hour of Code is just the first step on a journey to learn more about how technology works and how to create software applications. To continue this journey, find additional resources for educators [here][8]. Or encourage your children to learn [online][9]. [Sign up your event][10]
