title: Hour of Code Tutorial List
categories: [Resources]
---
Our activity is a set of 20 self-guided puzzles that teach the basics of computer science for users with no prior experience. In each puzzle, students write a program that gets a character through a maze. The activity uses Blockly, a visual programming language that has blocks you drag and drop to write programs. The activity includes instructional videos before puzzles #1, 6, 10, 14, 18, and a wrap-up video after the last puzzle. The characters in our activity are from the popular kidsâ€™ games Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies.
