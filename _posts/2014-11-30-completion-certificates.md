When you complete any part of the **Hour of Code** for your **Hour of Code** event.


Get your completion certificates ready for the day by setting up a batch print [here](http://code.org/certificates). 
Please note that students will also be able to send a certificate by email at the completion of a [code.org]http://code.org/tutorial) tutorial. The batch printing is just a convenient way to get them ready prior to your event.
