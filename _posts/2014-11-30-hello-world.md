Would you like to learn more about computer science, programming and robotics? You are invited to participate in the Hour of Code! 

Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify it and show that anybody can learn the basics of coding and robotics. You don't need experience! 

Our goal is simple: we want more people to understand what technology really is and encourage kids to consider IT as a career.

The Hour of Code is a global movement reaching tens of millions of students in 180+ countries. The largest learning event in history will take place in 2014 during Computer Science Learning Week from December 8th to December 14th - please join us and explore the world of computer science!
