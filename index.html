<h2 id="whatisthehourofcode">What is the Hour of Code?</h2>

<p>The Hour of Code is a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify code and show that anybody can learn the basics. <a href="/kids-code-hour/tutorials-list">Check out the tutorials</a>, and look out for new ones coming for the Hour of Code 2014.</p>

<p><a href="http://code.org/learn"> Try last year's tutorials  </a></p>

<h2 id="whenisthehourofcode">When is the Hour of Code?</h2>

<p>Anybody can host an Hour of Code anytime, but the grassroots campaign goal is for tens of millions of students to try an Hour of Code during December 8-14, 2014, in celebration of <a href="http://csedweek.org">Computer Science Education Week</a>. Is it one specific <em>hour</em>? No. You can do the Hour of Code anytime during this week. (And if you can't do it during that week, do it the week before or after).</p>

<h2 id="whycomputerscience">Why computer science?</h2>

<p><em>Every</em> student should have the opportunity to learn computer science. It helps nurture problem-solving skills, logic and creativity. By starting early, students will have a foundation for success in any 21st-century career path. See more stats on <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="whoisbehindthehourofcode">Who is behind the Hour of Code?</h2>

<p>The Hour of Code is organized by <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a>, a public 501c3 non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it available in more schools, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented students of color. An <a href="http://code.org/about/partners">unprecedented coalition of partners</a> have come together to support the Hour of Code, too — including Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the College Board.</p>

<h2 id="idontknowanythingaboutcodingcanistillhostanevent">I don't know anything about coding.</h2>

<p>Hour of Code activities are self-guided. All you have to do is <a href="http://code.org/learn">try our current tutorials</a>, pick the tutorial you want, and pick an hour — code.org takes care of the rest. We also have options for every age and experience-level, from kindergarten and up. Start planning your event by reading our <a href="/kids-code-hour/resources/">resources</a>.</p>

<h2 id="doineedcomputersforeveryparticipant">Do I need computers for every participant?</h2>

<p>No. We have Hour of Code tutorials that work on PCs, smartphones, tablets, and some that require no computer at all! You can join wherever you are, with whatever you have.</p>

<p><em>Here are a few options:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Work in pairs.</strong> Research shows students learn best with <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/resources/pair-programming-box-power-collaborative-learning">pair programming</a>, sharing a computer and working together. Encourage your students to double up.</li>
<li><strong>Use a projected screen.</strong> If you have a projector and screen for a Web-connected computer, your entire group can do an Hour of Code together. Watch video portions together and take turns solving puzzles or answering questions.</li>
<li><strong>Go unplugged.</strong> We offer tutorials that require no computer at all.</li>
</ul>
